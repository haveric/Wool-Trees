CHANGE LOG:  --------------------------------------------------------

Version ???
* Vault is no longer needed for Permissions. Any permission system will do. (It's still needed for economy though)
* Mixed case permissions are no longer supported. Make sure they are all lowercase.
* Added Metrics
* Added WorldGuard support. Can only affect trees if you can build there.

Version 1.2.1 (3/13/2012)
    + Added dev-url
    * Fixed items being used in creative mode
    * Made Vault an optional dependency.  If you don't have it, everyone can plant trees, but only op's can adjust values.

Version 1.2 (2/18/12)
    * Updated to new Events system
    * Fixed a bug that removed all single stacks of a dye when dying a tree
    / Modified commands to remove getters (current values are now shown in /wt)
    + Added option for wool trunks.
    / Made pattern trees optional
    + Added /wt here [wool% 0-100] [big] [color]  (all optional, order doesn't matter)
      Uses: /wt here 50 blue green big = big blue/green tree with 50% leaves
          : /wt here = small white tree with 100% leaves
    
Version 1.1.1 (12/14/11)
    * Fixed dependency on Vault
    * Fixed a case when econ was null and still trying to withdraw money

Version 1.1 (12/12/11)
    * Updated to use Vault for permissions and economy
    + Added optional check for block height (6 for normal trees, 9 for large)
    + Added check for light level (0-15)
    + Added "pattern" trees. Add multiple colors to a sapling to create multicolored trees
    / Altered fully random "multicolored" trees.  Now are created with three specific colors.
    - Removed versions folders from jar file.. no wonder they were so big

Version 1.0.6 (9/29/11)
    Op should now have adjust perms always.
    Support for more economy plugins(Register): Tested with iConomy 5, others that should work: iConomy 6, BOSEconomy, Essentials, and Multiple Currency
Version 1.0.5 (8/23/11)
    Fixed bonemeal again.
    Permission .ignorecost now works as both (.ignorecost and .ignoreCost)
    Initial code cleanup.  More will come when I have free time.
Version 1.0.4 (8/22/11)
    Permissions now support camelCase (ex: - woolTrees.plant and - wooltrees.plant both work)
    New permission:
        - woolTrees.ignorecost (Allows a user or group to always have free trees)
    Fixed the hooks for Permissions and iConomy so the plugin works without them as it was intended to.
        If you don't have iConomy, all trees are free.
        If you don't have Permissions, in-game commands are disabled so only the op can change variables.
Version 1.0.3 (8/21/11)
    iConomy support
        -cost variable added to config (initial value of 1000)
    Added in-game commands
    White wool trees are now possible with sugar (don't ask how sugar makes wool..)

Version 1.0.2 (8/18/11)
    Fixed black dye(ink sacs). Bonemeal should now act normally.

Version 1.0.1 (8/18/11)
    Chance for Multicolored trees to be created.
    Config file to adjust the following (all from 0-100):
        Big Tree Spawn %: Chance of a big tree spawning.
        Tree Spawn %: Chance of a tree spawning in the first place.
        Wool Spawn %: Chance that each block of wool in the tree will be wool instead of air.
        Multicolored Tree Spawn %: Chance that a tree will be random colors.

Version 1 (8/17/11)
    Created the plugin.
    Supports the use of Permissions
